# Thesis Project: Agent-Based Model with Dynamic Network

This repository contains code for a thesis project focusing on an agent-based model where agents play games on a dynamic network. The agents' behavior is influenced by factors such as risk aversion and bounded rationality.

## Overview

The thesis project aims to simulate interactions among agents in a dynamic network environment. The agents engage in games, and their decisions are influenced by various factors, including risk aversion and bounded rationality. The project explores how these factors impact the behavior and outcomes of agents within the network.

## Installation

To run the experiments, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KarinLeanne/master_thesis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd master_thesis
    ```

3. Create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

4. Activate the conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate master_thesis
    ```

5. Run the `main.py` script to execute all experiments:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
